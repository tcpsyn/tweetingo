This is a super simple twitter client that's likely of no use to anyone. 
I made it just to have a purpose in learning Go. 

You're welcome to use it if for some reason you want to, but you'll need to register an application
with twitter to obtain a consumerkey and secret for oauth authentication.

It's pretty annoying.
